Bubblesort:Bubble Sort is the simplest array sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Write an assembly
language program to implement Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a given array of 8
elements in Ascending order

Analog2digital: In order to convert an analog signal to a digital signal, the 3 steps to be
followed are sampling, quantization and encoding. Assume that a sampled signal
(consisting of 8 samples in the range 0 to 40) is present. Write an assembly code to
quantize the signal into 4 discrete levels. Follow the below scheme.
if (sample >= 0 and sample < 10):
output 5
else if (sample >= 10 and sample < 20):
output 15
else if (sample >= 20 and sample < 30):
output 25
else:
output 35
