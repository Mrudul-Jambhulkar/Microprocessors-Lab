Bubblesort:Bubble Sort is the simplest array sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Write an assembly
language program to implement Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a given array of 8
elements in Ascending order

Analog2digital: In order to convert an analog signal to a digital signal, the 3 steps to be
followed are sampling, quantization and encoding. Assume that a sampled signal
(consisting of 8 samples in the range 0 to 40) is present. Write an assembly code to
quantize the signal into 4 discrete levels. Follow the below scheme.
if (sample >= 0 and sample < 10):
output 5
else if (sample >= 10 and sample < 20):
output 15
else if (sample >= 20 and sample < 30):
output 25
else:
output 35

display_encoded_signals_LED:  Using the board to read inputs, quantize and encode the inputs,
and display the encoded digital outputs using the on-board LEDs.

keyboardinterfacing:The task is to write an embedded C program to read password using
keypad and grant (or deny) access based on the correctness of the password.

musicalnotes:Used software delays to produce square wave-forms of appropriate frequency.
Based on the inputs given through switches (P1.0 to P1.3), the square waveform of required frequency must be written to P0.7. 

stopwatch:Embedded C code to create a STOP-WATCH using external
event counter and LCD
